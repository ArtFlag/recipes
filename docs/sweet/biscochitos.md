- Anise seed: 1/2 tablespoon
- Baking powder: 5 teaspoons
- Brandy or wine (can use milk instead, then add 1 tablespoon vanilla): 1/4 cup
- Eggs: 2
- Flour: 5 cups
- Salt: 1/2 tsp
- Shortening (or lard, or half lard and half shortening): 4 cups
- Sugar: 1 1/2 cups

1. Mix a 1/4 cup of sugar with fresh cinnamon for dipping the cookies and set aside.
1. Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt together.  Sift well and then set aside.
1. Beat the shortening until creamy, add sugar a little at a time, beating continuously.
1. Add eggs one at a time, continuing to beat, then add the brandy or wine and continue to
   beat for at least another minute.
1. Add the anise, and mix.
1. Add this mixture to the flour mixture and knead well.
1. Roll the dough very thin and then use cookie cutters into desired shapes.
   (you can put the dough in refrigerator to make easier to roll out)
1. Bake at 180c for about 12 minutes or until golden brown.
1. While the cookies are still hot, dip both sides into the sugar/cinnamon mixture. (cookies should be hot so the sugar/cinnamon sticks to the cookies.)
