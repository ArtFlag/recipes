## Ingredients

### Syrup

- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 1 cup honey
- 1 cup water
- 1 lemon, sliced
- 2 cinnamon sticks

### Filling

- 2 cups de-shelled pistachio
- ½ tsp ground cinnamon
- 3 Tbsp white sugar
- 1 cup/250g melted unsalted butter
- ½ lb phyllo dough

## Recipe

### Syrup

:::note
Karakoy Gulluoglu makes it at the end and pours it at 60c on the hot baklava.
:::

1. Combine granulated sugar, honey, water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil and simmer until thickened
   and reduced, about 12 minutes.
1. Once homogenous, kill the heat and add 1 sliced lemon and 2 cinnamon sticks.
1. Set aside at room temperature until ready to use. (The syrup should be at room
   temperature and still pourable when ready to use; if cooled too much, reheat slightly.)

### Filling

1. Start by deshelling 2 cups worth of pistachios (or buy the de-shelled pistachios).
1. In a food processor, mix together the pistachio, cinnamon, and sugar. Set aside.

### Assembly Method

1. Place the yufka on a wet kitchen towel.
1. Preheat the oven to 180°F. Brush the bottom and sides of a 22x33cm baking dish with some of the melted butter.
1. Place a layer of phyllo in the bottom of the dish, cover with another layer, and brush the top with butter.
1. Add another layer, brushing the top with butter, and then another layer, brushing the top with butter until
   you have a stack 6 sheets high.
1. Spread 1/3 of the filling evenly over the phyllo.
1. Layer and butter another 3 sheets in the same way.
1. Spread another 1/3 of the filling over it.
1. Layer and butter another 3 sheets in the same way and spread with the final third of the filling.
1. Top the final nut layer with the remaining 6 filo sheets, buttering every other one as above.
1. Finally, brush the top layer of filo with butter. Place in the fridge for 1 hour.
1. With a sharp knife, cut through all the layers down to the bottom of the dish, making 16 to 18 diamonds or 1 1/2-inch square sections.
1. Place in the oven and bake for 45 minutes.
1. While still warm, pour the syrup in between the cuts and around the edges of the sections, taking care to
   avoid the top or else it will get soggy.
1. Set aside at room temperature until completely cool.
1. To serve, lift out the pieces as outlined. Serve right away or cover and store at room temperature for up to 5 days.
