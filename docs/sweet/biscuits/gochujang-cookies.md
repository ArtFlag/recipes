## Ingredients

Gochujang Caramel Swirl
- 2 tablespoons (28 g) unsalted butter room temperature
- ¼ cup (50 g) brown sugar packed
- 2 ½ tablespoons (50 g) Gochujang

Cookie Dough
- 2 ½ cup (320 g) all-purpose flour spooned and leveled
- 2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon cinnamon
- 14 tablespoons (198 g) unsalted butter room temperature
- 1 ¼ cup (250 g) granulated sugar
- 1 egg room temperature
- 1 egg yolk room temperature
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
1. Gochujang caramel: In a small bowl, mix the unsalted butter, 2 tablespoons brown sugar, and gochujang until combined. Set aside.
1. Whisk dry ingredients: In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon.
1. Beat butter and sugar. In a large mixing bowl, use an electric mixer with a paddle or beater attachment and beat the butter and sugar on medium speed until light and fluffy about 2-3 minutes.
1. Add eggs and vanilla. Add the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract and beat until combined. Scrape the edges of the bowl and mix to combine.
1. Combine dry ingredients. Slowly add in the flour mixture and mix until combined. Cover and refrigerate the dough for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour.
1. Prepare oven. While dough chills, preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line cookie sheets with parchment paper.
1. Create gochujang swirl. Place dollops of the gochujang paste into the cookie dough and gently swirl the paste in the dough with a rubber spatula. Do not mix in completely.
1. Assemble. Scoop the cookies onto your lined baking sheets leaving spacing them at least 2 inches apart.
1. Bake. Bake the cookies one tray at a time for 11-13 minutes or until the edges are lightly golden brown. Then remove the baking tray from the oven and cool for 5 minutes before cooling them completely on a wire rack. For perfectly round cookies, take a round cookie cutter and swirl them around each gochujang cookie immediately when you take them out of the oven. Enjoy!
