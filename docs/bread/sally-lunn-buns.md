-   Bread flour: 3 3/4 cup (450g)
-   Butter at room temperature: 6 tablespoons (85g)
-   Eggs: 3 (2 for the dough, 1 for the baking)
-   Instant yeast or active dry yeast: 7g
-   Lemon zest: 1 lemon
-   Saffron threads: 2-3 (optional)
-   Salt: 1 ½ teaspoons
-   Sugar: ¼ cup (50g)
-   Whole milk: 1 ¼ cup (280ml)

1.  If you are using instant yeast, heat the full amount of milk. If you
    are using active dry yeast, warm only 1 cup on the stove. Take the
    other 1/4 cup and mix with the yeast and a sprinkle of sugar to
    activate the yeast.
2.  Warm the milk over low heat and add the sugar and dissolve.
3.  Once warm, add the butter and melt in. Add the saffron to the milk
    and set mixture aside to cool to 40° or cooler before adding it to
    the other ingredients.
4.  Sift the flour into a large bowl. If using instant yeast, add it to
    the flour.
5.  Once the milk mixture is cooled to 40°:
    1.  Remove saffron threads with a strainer.
    2.  Add to flour and mix.
    3.  Add lemon zest, the 2 eggs and salt and mix.
    4.  If you are using active dry yeast, add that last.
6.  Work dough until it comes together and forms a smooth sticky dough.
    (about 8 minutes on medium speed) it will not form into a ball.
7.  Cover and let rise for 60 - 90 minutes or until doubled in size.
8.  Once doubled, punch down dough and put it onto a lightly floured
    surface and separate into 3 or 6 pieces.
9.  Form dough into balls and place on lined baking sheet, slightly
    flattening into a cake.
10. Cover and let rise for another 45 - 60 minutes.
11. Preheat oven to 200°c and make an egg wash with either a whole egg
    or egg white if you used the saffron for color.
12. Bake buns for 15 minutes, tenting them if they begin to brown too
    much. An instant read thermometer should read approx 90°c.
13. Cool on a wire rack and serve warm with butter, jam or clotted
    cream.
