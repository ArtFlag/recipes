Yields: 8 to 12 pieces.

Dough:

- Instant yeast: 1 tablespoon (9g)
- Bread flour: 4 cups (480g)
- Salt: 2 teaspoons (12g)
- (Optional) Brown sugar, or barley malt syrup: 1 tablespoon (14g)
- Luke warm water: 1 1/3 cups (303g)
- Eggs: 1 (egg wash)

Water bath:

For 2 quarts (1814g) water:

Either:

- Brown sugar or honey : 2 tablespoons (28g)
- Granulated sugar: 1 tablespoon (14g)

or

- Baking soda 15g
- honey: 30g

## Dough

1. Combine all of the dough ingredients and knead vigorously for 10 minutes (if you're using an electric mixer)
   or up to 15 minutes (if you're kneading by hand).
1. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover, and set it aside to rise until it's noticeably puffy
   though not necessarily doubled in bulk, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.
1. Lightly grease two baking sheets, or line them with parchment and grease the parchment.
1. Transfer the dough to a work surface. Divide it into balls of 70-90g. About 10 balls.
1. Ball each piece. Place the balls on one of the prepared baking sheets. Cover the balls with plastic wrap, and let them rest for 30 minutes or up to 2 days in the fridge.
1. While the dough is resting, prepare the water bath by heating the water (+brown sugar or barley malt syrup, and sugar) to a very gentle boil in a large, wide-diameter pot.
1. Preheat your oven to 220Â°c.
1. Use your index finger to poke a hole through the center of each ball, then twirl the dough on your finger to stretch the
   hole until it's about 3.5cm to 5cm in diameter.
