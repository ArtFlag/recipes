## Sourdough

1.  Mix the water and the salt until disolved. Add around 10% of flour.
    Add the levain and mix. And the rest of the ingredients.
2.  Fold the dough several times. Flour a bit more if the dough remains
    too sticky.
3.  Leave to rest at room temp 20 minutes.
4.  Take the dough out on a floured countertop and give it a few folds.
    It shouldn't stick anymore.
5.  Split the dough into the appropriate number of boules. Do not make
    the boules too tight. Keep in a tight container.
6.  Leave to proof for the number of hours in the table. It should have
    doubled in size.
