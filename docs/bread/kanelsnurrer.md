**Dough**

Milk (whole): 20 cl
yeast: 7g (25g fresh)
eggs: 2
salt: 1 tsp
sugar: 2 tbsp.
cardamom or vanilla sugar: 1 tsp
butter: 100 g
Wheat flour: 500g

**Filling**

soft butter: 200 g
sugar: 200 g
ground cinnamon: 3 tbsp

1 beaten egg for brushing

## Method

1. Stir the yeast into 20cl lukewarm milk.
1. Add 2 eggs, 1tsp salt and 2tbsp sugar and either cardamom or vanilla sugar to the yeast mixture.
1. Mix the yeast mixture and the flour mixture, and knead the dough very smoothly.
1. Work the 100g of soft butter in the flour mix.
1. Cover and let rise until doubled in size.

1. Stir butter, sugar and cinnamon together.
1. Roll out the dough into a rectangle on a floured board (30 x 42 cm). Grease the filling.
1. Fold ⅓ of the dough over the filling. Fold the other ⅓ inwards so that all the filling is now completely closed inside. Carefully roll out to a width of approx. 22-25 cm. Cut into 3 cm wide strips. Twist the strips. One end is twisted twice around the index and middle fingers of the opposite hand, and one end is stopped down the middle. Or gather the twisted dough into a ring.
1. Place them on a baking sheet. Let the spinners rise for 15 min. Brush with beaten egg. Also brush over the cinnamon filling so it does not run out during baking.
1. Behind the spinners on the middle groove for approx. 15-18 min. at 200 degrees.
