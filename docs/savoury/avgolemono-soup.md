-   Chicken breasts: 2
-   Chicken broth: 8 cups (including one jar of thick chicken broth from
    the supermarket)
-   Finely chopped carrots: 1/2 to 1 cup
-   Finely chopped celery: 1/2 to 1 cup
-   Finely chopped garlic cloves: 2
-   Finely chopped green onions: 1/2 to 1 cup
-   Fresh parsley or dill
-   Kosher salt: 1.5 tsp
-   Large eggs: 2 or 3 small ones
-   Lemon juice: 1/2 cup
-   Olive oil: 1 tbsp
-   Rice: 1 cup
-   Thyme/rosemary

1.  In a large heavy pot, heat 1 tbsp olive oil on medium-high. Saute
    the carrots, celery and green onions, then stir in the garlic.
2.  In the slow cooker, add the water with the broth, herbs and the
    chicken and set to `high`.
3.  Once the liquid is boiling, add the rice, salt and pepper.
4.  Turn the heat to medium-low and simmer for 20 minutes or until the
    rice is tender.
5.  Shred the chicken and put it back in the slow cooker.
6.  Prepare the egg-lemon sauce:
    1.  In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs and add the lemon juice
        gradually.
    2.  While whisking add 2 ladles-full of the broth from the cooking
        pot to start cooking the eggs slightly.
7.  Add the sauce to the main pot. Remove from heat immediately to
    prevent the eggs from coagulating.
8.  Garnish with fresh parsley or dill and serve.
