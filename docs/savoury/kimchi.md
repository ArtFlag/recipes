-   Fish Sauce: 2 tbsp (20ml)
-   Garlic Cloves: 4
-   Ginger: 1 tsp (6g)
-   Green Onions: 2
-   Korean Hot Pepper Flakes (to taste): 4.5 tbsp (38g)
-   Napa Cabbage: 1kg (one cabbage)
-   Onion: 1 onion
-   Apple: 1/2  (Optional)
-   Radish: 1
-   Rice flour: 2 tbsp
-   Salt
-   Sugar: 2 ¾ tsp (10g)
-   Water: 200 ml

1.  Trim the cabbage of any undesirable leaves.
2.  Cut the cabbage lengthwise into quarters and remove the cores. Chop
    the quarters into bite size pieces.
3.  Rinse the cabbage thoroughly and drain through a colander. Place the
    colander over a large bowl. Sprinkle liberally with salt and let it
    sit for 30 minutes.
4.  After 30 minutes, mix the cabbage and repeat by salting and letting
    sit for 30 minutes. Repeat one last time for a total of 3 times at
    30 minutes each or 1.5 hours.
5.  During one of the 30-minute waiting periods, make your rice
    porridge:
    1.  Combine the sweet rice flour and the water in a small saucepan,
        mix well, and bring the mixture to a boil.
    2.  Continue to stir until the porridge begins to bubble (about 5
        minutes).
    3.  Stir in the sugar and continue to cook for a few more minutes
        until the mixture is translucent. Set aside and let it cool.
6.  During the next 30-minute waiting period, make the kimchi paste:
    1.  Combine the garlic, ginger, onion, and fish sauce in a food
        processor. Process until the mixture is smooth.
    2.  Empty the mixture into a large bowl.
    3.  When the rice porridge has cooled, add it to the bowl.
    4.  Add in the hot pepper flakes and mix well until it looks like a
        consistent paste.
7.  Once you've salted and drained your cabbage all 3 times, rinse
    thoroughly in water and drain again.
8.  Add the cabbage and green onions to the chili paste and mix
    thoroughly until everything is well coated.
9.  Fill your jar(s) up to ¾ full.
10. Store in the fridge for about a month, checking on the kimchi
    regularly. Or if leaving in room temperature, store the jar(s) in a
    cool, dark place for a few days before transferring to the fridge.
