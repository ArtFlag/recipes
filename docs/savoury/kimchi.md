- Fish Sauce: 2 tbsp (20ml)
- Garlic Cloves: 4
- Ginger: 1 tsp (6g)
- Green Onions: 2
- Korean Hot Pepper Flakes (to taste): 4.5 tbsp (38g)
- Napa Cabbage: 1kg (one cabbage)
- Onion: 1 onion
- Apple: 1/2  (Optional)
- Rice flour: 2 tbsp
- Salt
- Sugar: 2 ¾ tsp (10g)
- Water: 200 ml

1. Trim the cabbage of any undesirable leaves.
1. Cut the cabbage lengthwise into quarters and remove the cores. Chop
   the quarters into bite size pieces.
1. Rinse the cabbage thoroughly and drain through a colander. Place the
   colander over a large bowl. Sprinkle liberally with salt and let it
   sit for 30 minutes.
1. After 30 minutes, mix the cabbage and repeat by salting and letting
   sit for 30 minutes. Repeat one last time for a total of 3 times at
   30 minutes each or 1.5 hours.

1. Make your rice porridge. Combine and bring to a boil in a small saucepan:
   - sweet rice flour (2 tbsp)
   - water (200ml),
1. Continue to stir until the porridge begins to bubble (about 5
   minutes).
1. Stir in the sugar and continue to cook for a few more minutes
   until the mixture is translucent. Set aside and let it cool.

1. Combine in a food processor. Process until the mixture is smooth:
   - Garlic Cloves: 4
   - Ginger: 1 tsp (6g)
   - Onion: 1
   - Fish Sauce: 2 tbsp (20ml)
1. Empty the mixture into a large bowl.
1. When the rice porridge has cooled, add it to the bowl.
1. Add in the hot pepper flakes and mix well until it looks like a
   consistent paste.

1. Once you've salted and drained your cabbage all 3 times, rinse
   thoroughly in water and drain again.
1. Add the cabbage and green onions to the chili paste and mix
   thoroughly until everything is well coated.
1. Fill your jar(s) up to ¾ full.

Store in the fridge for about a month, checking on the kimchi regularly. Or if
leaving in room temperature, store the jar(s) in a cool, dark place for a few
days before transferring to the fridge.
