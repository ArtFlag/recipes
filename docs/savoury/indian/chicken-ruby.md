## Makhani sauce

This rich, creamy sauce is used for the chicken ruby.

- 35g garlic (8-9 cloves)
- 175ml vegetable oil
- 20g fresh root ginger
- 800g chopped tomatoes (fresh or good-quality tinned)
- 2 bay leaves
- 6 green cardamom pods
- 2 black cardamom pods
- 2 cinnamon sticks
- 2 tsp fine sea salt
- 1 ½ tsp deggi mirch chilli powder
- 30g butter
- 1 tsp garam masala
- 20g granulated sugar
- 1 tbsp runny honey
- 1 tsp ground cumin
- 1 tsp dried fenugreek leaves, crushed to a powder between your fingers
- ½ tsp fresh dill fronds.
- 80ml double cream

1. Take 15g garlic and finely dice it. Warm a large saucepan over a medium-high heat
   and add the oil. Toss in the chopped garlic and fry until light golden brown and slightly crispy, about 7-8 minutes.
   Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper.
2. Grate the remaining garlic and the ginger to a fine paste
   on a microplane, or grind using a pestle and mortar.
3. Using a blender, blitz the chopped tomatoes to a fine
   consistency.
4. Place the saucepan containing the oil back over a
   medium-high heat and add the bay leaves, green
   and black cardamom pods and the cinnamon sticks.
   Let them crackle for 1 minute, stirring regularly.
5. Turn the heat down and add the garlic and ginger paste.
   Cook for 5 minutes, allowing the paste to brown but
   not burn.
6. Add the tomatoes, salt and chilli powder to the pan.
   Bring to a rapid simmer and cook until reduced by half,
   stirring regularly so that it doesn't catch. This should
   take about 30 minutes.
7. Add the butter and simmer for a further 5 minutes.
8. Add the garam masala, sugar, honey, cumin, crispy
   garlic, dried fenugreek and fresh dill fronds and cook
   for a further 15 minutes.
9. If the sauce is to be used straight away, add the cream
   and simmer gently for 5 minutes; it is then ready to
   use. If not using immediately, alow to cool, cover and
   refrigerate; add the cream when you reheat the sauce
   to assemble your dish.
