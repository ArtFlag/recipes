1. Preheat the oven to 180.
2. Whisk eggs briefly, heavy cream and salt until you get a smooth and even texture. Set aside.
3. Cut tomatoes in half. Chop bell peppers into small pieces.
4. Quickly pre-cook veggies, about 5 minutes.
5. Pour over the egg mixture. Sprinkle the cheese on top. Using a fork, distribute the cheese around a little to incorporate it into the eggs.
6. Transfer to oven-safe container.
7. Bake for 15 to 17 minutes, or until the edges are set and the top is lightly browned.
