## Sourdough tortillas

Yields 32 tortillas.

-   125 g sourdough starter (discard or active, 100% hydration) (60)
-   320 g warm water about 40c (160)
-   56 g vegetable oil (25)
-   2 teaspoons kosher salt (1)
-   1/2 teaspoon baking powder (.25)
-   510+ g all-purpose flour (250+)
-   Plus extra flour for dusting

1.  Mix sourdough starter, water, oil, salt, baking powder, and 500 g of flour in the
    bowl of a stand mixer and knead with the dough hook for 4-6 minutes or by hand, until dough comes together in a smooth, non-sticky ball.
    If it’s too sticky, start adding the remaining cup of flour until you
    obtain the necessary consistency.

1.  Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a
    towel or plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature for about 30 minutes.

1.  Divide the dough into about 32 (16) equal pieces. 30 grams per piece.

1.  Roll each piece of dough into a ball. Use the traction of
    the counter to shape the balls.

1.  Cover dough pieces with a towel and let them rest for 5 minutes.
    Start rolling each dough piece into a circle that measures out about 17 cm in diameter.

1.  Start cooking the tortillas by heating up a cast iron frying pan or a non-stick frying
    pan over medium high heat.

1.  When the pan is hot, add a tortilla. Cook on one side for about 1
    minute, flip it over and cook on the other side for about 30 seconds.
    Cook it until it’s just slightly browned.

1.  Lay out cooked tortillas on a baking sheet and let them cool slightly before
    placing them in a tortilla warmer or closed container.

## Shortening tortillas

- 1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour (195g)
- ¾ teaspoon salt (3g)
- ¼ teaspoon baking powder (3g)
- ¼ cup vegetable shortening / Biskin Planzenfett (44g)
- ½ cup hot water (118g)

1. Whisk flour, salt, and baking powder together in a large bowl. Add vegetable shortening and work into flour mixture using a pastry cutter until it resembles coarse crumbs.

1. Form a well in the middle of flour mixture and mix in lukewarm water. Work flour and water mixture together with a fork and transfer to a cutting board.

1. Knead until a smooth, soft dough is formed, about 3 minutes. Add more flour if dough is too sticky.

1. Place more flour on cutting board, cover dough with bowl, and let rest for 15 minutes or more.

1. Cut ball of dough into eight equal parts and cover until needed.

1. Roll out balls of dough either by hand or with a tortilla press.

1. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place flattened tortilla in skillet and cook until it begins to bubble, about 1 minute. Flip tortilla over and cook for an additional minute. Flip again and cook for 1 more minute. Repeat with remaining dough.
