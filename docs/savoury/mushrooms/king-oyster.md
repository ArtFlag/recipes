tags: ["american", "mushroom", "sandwich"]
---

- 6 king oyster mushrooms (kräuter seitlinger), 'pulled'
- 1/2 tsp granulated garlic
- 2 tbsp onion/sage/parsley seasoning blend (or whatever you like/can find)
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 16 oz (454g) barbecue sauce
- Splash of beer (optional)
- Squishy burger buns

1. Preheat the oven to 200C.
1. Get your pan heating over medium-high heat.
1. Shred/pull the mushrooms by running a fork along the fibers, away from the cap. Pull apart with fingers and place the shreds into a large mixing bowl.
1. Add the granulated garlic, seasoning blend, salt and pepper to the bowl of shreds and gently toss to coat evenly.
1. Add the oil to the hot pan, swirl to coat the entire surface, then add the mushrooms. Spread the mushrooms around the pan evenly, then let them sear for about 5-6 minutes, stirring occasionally. You want the shrooms to get browned and some crispy bits to form, so don't move them around too much. Give them time for the water to cook out and then let the heat do its magic.
1. Once the mushrooms are looking good, transfer them back to the mixing bowl and add the BBQ sauce. If you'd like, add a splash of beer to the sauce to thin it out. Totally optional.
1. Stir the mushrooms in the sauce to coat evenly, then spread onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet.
1. Pop the shrooms into the oven and roast for about 10-12 minutes, giving them a quick stir about halfway through.
1. When the mushrooms are done, remove from the oven and set aside.
1. If you're making sandwiches, get your pan hot again. Butter (vegan) each side of your squishy buns and place them butter side down in the hot pan. Keep an eye on them and remove once they've reached your desired level of toasting.
