-   2 carrots, cut into matchsticks
-   2 cloves garlic, very finely minced

1.  Fill a large pot with water and boil. When water is boiling, add the
    noodles and cook for 5 minutes. Immediately drain and rinse with
    cold water. Drain again and toss with only 1 tsp of the sesame oil.
    Use kitchen shears to cut noodles into shorter pieces, about 8
    inches in length. Set aside.
2.  In bowl, mix soy sauce & sugar together. Add the cooking oil in a
    wok or large saute pan on high heat and swirl to coat. When the
    cooking oil is hot but not smoking. Fry onions and carrots, until
    just softened, about 1 minute. Add the garlic, scallions and
    mushrooms, fry 30 seconds. Then add the spinach, soy sauce, sugar
    and the noodles. Fry 2-3 minutes until the noodles are cooked
    through. Turn off heat, toss with sesame seeds and the remaining 1
    1/2 tsp of sesame oil.
