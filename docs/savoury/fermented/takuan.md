- 4 pounds daikon radish, washed, the tops trimmed, and dried for 3 days
- 1 ounce chija (gardenia fruits)
- 1.5 cup water
- 1/4 cup kosher salt
- 1/3 cup white or turbinado sugar
- ⅓  cup white vinegar
- 1 cup rice brance in fridge once cooled off.

1. Crush the chija (gardinia fruit) in a plastic bag. Transfer to a sauce pan. Add 1.5 cup water, cover, and boil for 20 minutes over medium high heat.
1. Remove from the heat and strain the solids over a bowl. Put them into a cheesecloth folded over a few times, with the top tied to make a pouch.
1. Put the strained chija water (about 1/3 cup) into a measuring cup. Add enough cold water to top it up to 1 cup.
1. Rinse out the sauce pan and put the cup of strained chija water back into it. Add the salt, sugar, vinegar, and the rice bran. Mix well and set aside.
1. Use a peeler to remove any brown spots and roots from the daikon.
1. Cut the tops and bottoms off the daikons so the the radishes are about 10 inches long. They should be able to fit comfortably into a gallon ziplock bag.
1. Add the pickle mixture and close the bag. Press gently and move the bag around, upside down and rightside up, so everything gets well mixed. Open the bag and add the gardenia pouch, too.Korean yellow pickled radish (danmuji: 단무지)
