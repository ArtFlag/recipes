   - 1 tbsp of water,
   - 1/2 of egg white,
   - 2 tbsp of cornstarch
1. Rub the marinade in the chicken until the chicken has a velvety texture.
1. Let the chicken sit for about 20 minutes.
1. In a small bowl, add:
   - 2 tsp of cornstarch
   - 1/2 tsp of white pepper (can also use black pepper)
   - 2 tbsp of soy sauce
   - 1 tbsp of oyster sauce
   - 1 tbsp of brown sugar
   - 1 tsp of grated ginger
   - 1 tsp of grated garlic
   - 1/2 cup of chicken stock
   - 1 tsp of dark soy sauce
1. Cut the broccoli into bite size and have some thin slices of carrot ready.
1. Heat the pan to medium-high heat and add your broccoli and the carrot. Slighty roast them.
1. In about 2 minutes, flip them over and sear the other side.
1. High heat + add about 2 tbsp of oil. Wait until the oil is hot then add your chicken, separate them. Make sure every piece of the chicken touches the bottom directly. Wait for 1 minute or 2 and you can check the color. If you see it is nice and brown on the bottom then flip all the chicken over. Fry the other side.
1. When both sides have nice color. Add the broccoli back to the wok. Give that a toss then pour in the sauce.
1. Toss everything together and correct salt.
1. Check the consistency of the sauce. When you see every piece of chicken and broccoli is coated nicely and the sauce is slightly thick, you can take it out.
