1.  Mix the water and the salt until disolved. Add around 10% of flour.

2.  Fold the dough several times. Flour a bit more if the dough remains
    too sticky.
3.  Leave to rest at room temp 20 minutes.
4.  Take the dough out on a floured countertop and give it a few folds.
    It shouldn't stick anymore.
5.  Split the dough into the appropriate number of boules. Do not make
    the boules too tight. Keep in a tight container.
6.  Leave to proof for the number of hours in the table. It should have
    doubled in size.
7.  Preheat oven to the max, with the pizza stone in it.
8.  On a floured surface, make the dough into a disc using its own
    weight.

    put the pizza on it, make sure it can slide off.
