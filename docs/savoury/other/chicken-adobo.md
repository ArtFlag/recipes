## Ingredients

### Chicken Adobo ingredients

- Bay leaves: 3
- Brown sugar (adjust to taste, or omit if using cane vinegar): 1–2 tbsp
- Neutral oil (canola, vegetable, or avocado oil): 2 tbsp
- Salt: Only if needed (soy adds a lot of salt already)
- Green onions or cilantro (chopped, for garnish): As needed
- Steamed white or jasmine rice (for serving): As needed

## Method

1. Combine soy sauce, vinegar, water, garlic, bay leaves in a large bowl. Mix well.
1. Marinate chicken in the mixture for 30 minutes. Not longer.
1. Prepare rice:
   1. Rince rice and start cooking it with water and salt in a rice cooker or pot.
   1. Slice garlic finely.
   1. Heat coconut oil in a pot over medium heat. Add garlic and sauté until golden brown.
   1. Add cooked rice and fish sauce to the pot. Mix well and keep warm.
1. Back the chicken:
   1. Take out chicken from marinade (reserve marinade) and pat dry.
   1. Add the water to marinade and brown sugar.
   1. Put chicken in a large pot over medium-high heat. Sear chicken on both sides until golden brown, about 3-4 minutes per side.
   1. Remove of the oil and grease and cook the onion.
   1. When cooked, add the chicken back to the pot.
   1. Pour marinade mixture over chicken.
   1. Get it to a simmer, cover partially, and cook for 30-40 minutes
   1. When thighs are at 190f/88c, kill the heat. Let rest for 20 minutes.
1.  After resting, remove chicken and set aside. Increase heat to medium-high and reduce sauce until slightly thickened, about 5-10 minutes. Pull out bay leaves.
1.  Optional: throw in a bit of coconut milk.
