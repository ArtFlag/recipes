- Chicken thighs: 4 bone-in, skin-on
- Olive oil: 2 tbsp
- Salt: 1 tsp
- Black pepper: to taste
- Garlic: 4 cloves, minced
- Onion: 1 medium, finely chopped
- White wine: 1 cup (dry white wine like Sauvignon Blanc)
- Chicken broth: 1 cup
- Heavy cream: 1/2 cup
- Fresh thyme: 2 sprigs
- Mustard: 1 tsp
- Butter: 2 tbsp


1. Season the chicken thighs with salt and black pepper on both sides.
1. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken thighs, skin-side down, and cook until the skin is golden brown and crispy, about 5-7 minutes. Flip and cook for another 5 minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.
1. In the same skillet, add the minced garlic and chopped onion. Sauté until the onion is translucent and fragrant, about 3-4 minutes.
1. Add 1 tbsp of flour to the skillet and stir well to coat the onions and garlic. Cook for another minute to remove the raw flour taste.
1. Pour in the white wine, scraping the bottom of the skillet to deglaze and incorporate any browned bits. Let it simmer for about 5 minutes until the wine reduces by half.
1. Add the chicken broth and fresh thyme to the skillet. Bring to a simmer.
1. Take a ladle of the sauce from the skillet and mix it with the mustard in a small bowl. Stir this mixture back into the skillet.
1. Return the chicken thighs to the skillet, skin-side up. Cover and let it cook for about 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through (internal temperature of 165°F or 74°C).
1. Remove the chicken from the skillet again and set aside. Discard the thyme sprigs.
1. Stir in the heavy cream and butter into the sauce. Let it simmer for another 5 minutes until the sauce thickens slightly. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper to taste.
1. Return the chicken to the skillet, spooning some sauce over the top. Serve hot with your choice of sides, such as mashed potatoes or steamed vegetables.
