## Ingredients

- Pecorino Romano DOP: 200g
- Black Pepper: 2 tablespoons, medium grind
- Pasta: 320g
- Water: 1.5l
- Salt: Minimal, adjust based on pecorino's saltiness

## Steps

1. **Grind Black Pepper**
   - Use a mortar and pestle or a pepper grinder set to medium coarseness.

2. **Cook Pasta for 6 minutes**
   - Boil pasta in half the usual amount of water (0.5 liters per 100g of pasta).
   - Do not add much salt, considering the saltiness of pecorino.

3. **Toast Black Pepper**
   - In a pan, toast the ground pepper until aromatic. Do not overheat or burn.
   - Add 3 ladles of pasta cooking water to the pan and reduce.

4. **Transfer Pasta**
   - Halfway through cooking, transfer pasta to the pan with pepper.
   - Add 1-2 ladles of cooking water and stir often.

5. **Prepare Pecorino Cream**
   - Mix pecorino with cooking water at a 2:1 ratio (200g pecorino to 100g water).
   - Ensure water temperature does not exceed 60Â°C to avoid melting.
   - Stir to achieve a ricotta-like consistency.

6. **Combine and Finish**
   - Once pasta is cooked and the water has evaporated, remove the pan from heat.
   - Add pecorino cream to pasta.
   - Mix for 3 minutes thoroughly to form a smooth sauce.

7. **Serve**
   - Plate the pasta and finish with a sprinkling of pecorino.
   - Serve immediately.
