## Seasoning

Choose unsaturated fats + high smoke point, example: Sunflowerseed oil, grapeseed oil and reach polymerization by heating.
Exceeding smoke point carbonizes the oil, which we don't want because it leads to cracking and flaking.

1. Clean pan and dry well.
1. Apply thin layer of oil, spread well with towel.
1. Bake for 1 hour a little under the oil's smokepoint.
