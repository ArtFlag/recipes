**Yield:** 6 servings
**Active Time:** 45 minutes
**Total Time:** 15 hours (includes resting periods)
**Difficulty:** Intermediate

## Equipment Required

- Stand mixer or large mixing bowl
- Pasta machine (highly recommended) or rolling pin
- Heavy-bottomed saucepan
- Baking sheet
- Parchment paper
- Kitchen scale (recommended)

## Ingredients

### For the Dough

- 250g (2 cups) all-purpose flour / manitoba
- 70g (5 tablespoons) lard or shortening
- 100g (⅓ cup + 1 tablespoon) water
- ½ tablespoon honey
- 5g Salt

### For the Filling

- 200g whole milk
- 100g semolina flour
- 200g ricotta cheese, drained
- 125g granulated sugar
- 1 egg yolk
- 2-3 tablespoons candied orange peel, finely diced, or chocolate chips
- Optional: cinamon and vanilla
- Powdered sugar for dusting

## Method

### Prepare the Dough

1. **Make initial dough:** In a large bowl, combine flour, salt, honey, and water.
   Mix until a rough, granular dough forms.

1. **First kneading:** Work the dough by hand until it forms a cohesive ball
   (5-8 minutes). The dough will be quite stiff.

1. **Flatten:** Flatten the dough and fold it over itself in between flattening sessions.

1. **Overnight rest:** Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 2-12
   hours.

1. **Prepare for rolling:** Remove dough from refrigerator 20-30 minutes before
   rolling to soften slightly.

1. **Roll the dough:** Using a pasta machine (starting at widest setting and
   progressing to thinnest) or a rolling pin, roll dough into a long, thin
   rectangle approximately 2-3mm thick.

1. **Create the spiral:** Starting from one short end, tightly roll the dough
   into a rolling pin. Let rest for 10min.

1. **Lard**: roll the dough out little by little, and brush with lard and roll it on itself.
   It should be compact without air bubble.

1. **Final rest:** Wrap the rolled pin in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at
   least 4 hours or up to 3 days.

### Prepare the Filling

1. **Cook semolina base:** Heat milk in a saucepan over medium heat. Gradually
   whisk in semolina, stirring constantly to prevent lumps. Cook for 3-4 minutes
   until thickened. Remove from heat and cool completely.

1. **Make ricotta mixture:** In a bowl, combine the drained ricotta, sugar, egg yolk, and
   candied orange peel. Mix until smooth.

1. **Combine fillings:** Fold the cooled semolina mixture into the ricotta
   mixture until well combined. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.

### Assemble and Bake

1. **Preheat oven:** Set to 180°C (350°F). Line a baking sheet with parchment
   paper.

1. **Cut portions:** Elongate the dough to about 6 cm diamater and 9cm length.
   Using a sharp knife, cut the chilled dough log into 1cm
   thick rounds.

1. **Shape shells:** Working with one round at a time, gently stretch and shape
   with your fingers to form a cone-shaped pocket, creating thin, flaky layers.
   The opening should be wide enough to fill.

1. **Fill:** Spoon 2-3 tablespoons of filling into each shell, ensuring they are
   well-filled but not overstuffed.

1. **Seal:** Pinch the edges together to seal, leaving the top slightly open if
   desired (traditional style).

1. <BakingStep temp="200c" time="18-22 minutes" preheat /> No fan.

1. **Finish:** Cool for 5 minutes, then dust with powdered sugar before serving.

## Critical Success Factors

- **Temperature control:** Keep dough cold during resting periods to maintain
  layers
- **Thin rolling:** The thinner the dough, the more delicate the final texture
- **Proper sealing:** Coat with lard between each turn to prevent layers from
  sticking together
- **Don't overfill:** Excess filling will cause shells to burst during baking

## Storage and Serving

- **Best served:** Within 2-3 hours of baking for optimal crispness
- **Storage:** Store unfilled shells in airtight container for up to 2 days; fill
  just before serving
- **Reheating:** Warm in 150°C (300°F) oven for 3-4 minutes to restore crispness

## Variations

- **Citrus:** Replace candied orange with candied lemon or cedro
- **Enhanced filling:** Add 2-3 tablespoons of pastry cream to the ricotta
  mixture
- **Alternative fat:** Substitute lard with high-quality shortening or butter
  (flavor will differ slightly)
