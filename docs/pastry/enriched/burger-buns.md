**For the scald**

- 60g (2.1oz) white bread flour
- 20g (0.7oz) butter
- 20g (0.7oz) sugar
- 6g (0.21oz) salt
- 190g (6.7oz) boiling water

**For the main dough**

1. 240g white bread flour
1. 3g instant dry yeast or 3.6g active dry yeast or 9g fresh yeast
1. 1 egg yolk
1. 1 egg white for glazing
1. Sesame seeds to sprinkle

1. Make the scald. Mix all ingredients until smooth and leave to cool down. We are aiming for a final dough temperature of around 25C, so let the scald come down to that temperature. It will take around 3 hours. Alternatively, you could use less boiling water in the scald and top it up with cold water to balance the temperature if you want to speed up the process.
1. Make the dough. Add the yeast and egg yolk to the scald and whisk until smooth. Add the flour and mix to a dough.
1. Cover and chill for 15-30 minutes.
1. Fold #1.
1. Chill for 15-30 more minutes.
1. Fold #2.
1. Cold ferment for 12-24 hours.
1. Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces and pre-shape. Rest for 20 minutes.
1. Final shape. Place the dough balls on a non-stick paper lined tray with plenty of space between them.
1. Cover and final proof for 2 hours.
1. Brush the dough balls with egg white and sprinkle with seeds.
