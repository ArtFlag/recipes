## With Tangzhong

export var proportion = "10"
export const tflour = i.flour*proportion/100
export const twater = i.flour*proportion/100*2

### Tangzhong

Use 10%-20% of the original flour as tangzhong. Mix until mix reaches 65c.

:::note[Example]
{proportion}% of the original recipe, with 1:2 ratios:

- Flour: {tflour}
- Water: {twater}
:::

### Tortillas

- All-purpose flour: {i.flour - tflour}g
- Baking powder: {i.bakingPowder}g
- Water: {i.water - twater}g (a bit more if dough too dry)
- Salt: {i.salt}g
- Vegetable shortening / Biskin Planzenfett: {i.shortening}g

### Method

1. If using tangzhong, prepare the thangzhong and set aside for 6h-1day in the fridge.

1. Whisk flour, salt, and baking powder together in a large bowl. Add vegetable shortening and work into flour mixture using a pastry cutter until it resembles coarse crumbs.

1. Add thanzong.

1. Form a well in the middle of flour mixture and mix in lukewarm water. Work flour and water mixture together with a fork and transfer to a cutting board.

1. Knead until a smooth, soft dough is formed, about 3 minutes. Add more flour if dough is too sticky.

1. Place more flour on cutting board, cover dough with bowl, and let rest for 15 minutes or more.

1. Cut ball of dough into eight equal parts and cover until needed.

1. Roll out balls of dough either by hand.

1. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place flattened tortilla in skillet and cook until it begins to bubble, about 1 minute. Flip tortilla over and cook for an additional minute. Flip again and cook for 1 more minute. Repeat with remaining dough.

## Corn

- 2 1/2 cups (230g) Masa Harina
- pinch (5g) salt
- 1 2/3 cups (360g) water, warm

1. In a large, shallow mixing bowl, combine the masa harina and salt. Gradually add the warm water, stirring with your hands to make a cohesive dough.
1. Using your hands, mix and knead the dough in the bowl for a minute or so, until it's smooth and somewhat firm; it should feel like Play-Doh.

   - If the dough sticks to your hands and feels wet, add more masa harina a
     teaspoon to a tablespoon at a time.
   - If you roll a piece into a ball and squeeze it and the edges crack, add more water a
     teaspoon to a tablespoon at a time.

Divide the dough into 16 pieces (about 35g to 40g each) and roll each piece into a ball. Place the balls on a clean work surface and cover them with plastic or a damp kitchen towel to keep them moist.

Preheat a comal, a cast iron or nonstick pan, or a griddle over medium heat for 5 minutes, or until evenly hot.
