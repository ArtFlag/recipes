- Instant Yeast 3.33g ≈ 1tsp / half a packet
- Salt 8g ≈ 1.5 tsp

- Water 270ml ≈ 1 1/8 cup

- Water 150ml ≈ 5/8 cup
- Instant Yeast 3.33g ≈ 1tsp / half a packet

- Superfine sugar / Caster sugar 20g ≈ 2.5 tbsp

1. In a standmixer with the dough-hook attached, add all the dy ingredients for the bread.
1. With the mixer going, slowly add the water. Let the mixer run until the dough comes together to forms a ball.
1. Once the dough forms a ball, let the mixer knead it for 10 minutes.
1. Cut it into 2 even pieces.
1. Form a ball of each piece, making sure you create a good amount of tension on the skin.
1. Put the dough balls, seam down, on a cookie sheet. Cover with a towel, and let it rise for 30 minutes in a warm spot.
1. In a bowl, mix all the ingredients for the rice paste, until it's fully combined.
1. Cover with plastic wrap, and put it in a warm spot to rise, until you're ready to bake the bread.

1. After the first rise, flatten the two dough balls, and roll them into two small logs with sharp points at the end. Make sure you put tension on the skin of the dough.
1. Put these, seam down, on the cookie sheet, and cover them with a towel. Let them rise in a warm spot for 20 minutes.

1. After the second rise, put the dough, seam up, on your floured work surface, and flatten it.
1. Fold the two sides inward, so the dough forms a trapezoid shape. Roll the dough into a tight loaf, from the small side of the trapezoid towards the large side.
1. Place the two loaves on your cookie sheet (seam down), and brush the top with water.
1. Do not cover them, and let them rise in a warm spot for 60 minutes

1. After the bread has risen a third time, get the rice paste from where it was rising. Stir it through, and add some water if it has gotten too thick.
1. Spread a layer of the rice paste on the top of the breads with your hand. Make sure it's just on the top, and not too thick. Once it's on, do not mess with it. If any of the paste is on the sides of the bread, remove it.
1. Let the bread rest on the counter, while you preheat the oven to **240** no fan.
1. Once the oven is preheated, put the breads on the middle rack, and add water to the cookie sheet on the lower rack.
1. Immediately lower the temperature to 220c and bake for **10 minutes**.
1. Lower the temperature of the oven to 200c and bake the bread for **10-15 minutes**, or until the crust is nice and golden brown.
