## Poolish pita

- 100 gr bread flour
- 100 gr fruit yeast water (or 100 gr water + 1/4th tsp instant yeast)

1. Combine all ingredients in a medium-small mixing bowl, until all the flour is properly hydrated.
2. Cover and leave for 4h at room temp or up to 24 hours in the fridge.


FINAL DOUGH
200 gr poolish
60 gr water
5 gr salt
5 gr sugar
16 gr olive oil
150 gr bread flour

3. Mix and kead until it has developed some gluten.
4. Cover the dough to prevent it drying and let it rest for 30 minutes.
5. Continue kneading the dough for another 9 - 10 minute until it passes the windowpane test: h
6. Prepare a bowl by lining it with olive oil.
7. Round the dough into a boule and then place into the lined bowl.
8. Leave to rise until the dough doubles  in size, about 4 - 5 hours at 25Â°C. If desired, you can also cold ferment or retard the dough by placing it into the fridge for up to 18 hours.
9. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface.
10. Fold it into a rectangle, patting out any large bubbles along the way.
11. Using a scraper, divide it into 5 equal pieces. On a scale, each should weigh about 85-87 grams.
12. Make each piece into a round ball and leave them to rest for 30 minutes.
14. Roll out all the dough portions with a rolling pin to under 0.5 cm thickness.
15. Cover with a cloth, and let the rolled out disks rest on a floured surface for 25 minutes.
16. Prepare a pan by preheating it to a searing hot temperature, you should be able to feel the heat with your hand above the pan.
17. Turn the heat down just before putting the pitas in. Put them in top side down.
18. Flip the pita a few times to prevent burning.
19. After a few flips, the pita will puff and it is done at that point. You can cook for longer for more browning on the sides.

1. Divide the dough into 4 equal pieces and shape them into balls.
1. Place the dough balls on to an oiled plate and rub lightly with oil all over.
1. Cover the dough balls and cold ferment them for 24 hours.
1. Pre-heat your oven and baking tray/steel/stone to 250C (480F) fan off. The oven must be very hot, so heat it for at least 40 minutes.
1. Dust the dough ball generously with flour and roll it flat with a rolling pin. But do not make it too thin or else it will not rise well. Bake one at a time and adjust if need be. Also, note the orientation of the dough. It must face the same way as it was sitting on the plate.
1. Place the flattened dough onto the preheated tray and bake for 3-4 minutes.
