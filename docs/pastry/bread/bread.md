title: Sourdough bread
---

## Starter

Prepare sourdough starter. The Jar weighs 170g.
Add water/flour in equal parts to keep 10g-20g of starter after using what you need.

:::tip Example
You have 10g of starter. You need 100g for the bread, so add 55g of water and 55g flour.
and you'll keep 20g of starter at the end.
:::

The starter is fully active when it has doubled in size or more and is not yet collapsing.
It should show a dome shape at its top.

:::note
You can still make bread with a non-active starter, but it takes longer to ferment.
