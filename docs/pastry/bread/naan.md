1. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface, knead the dough well. Apply light oil to the dough and cover.
1. Let the dough sit for about 3 hours in warm place.
1. Dough should have risen 1-1/2 time. Knead the dough again on floured surface. Divide the dough in four parts, lightly roll into the flour, cover the balls and let it sit for about five minutes before rolling.
1. Roll the naan one at a time on a lightly floured surface little less than 1/4 inch thick. Sprinkle the water lightly on one side of the naan.
1. Heat the tawa on medium heat, to check if tawa is ready sprinkle the few drops of water on tawa, water should sizzle.
1. Put water side naan over tawa, once the naan start bubbling and dough start drying, turn the tawa over flames keeping about 2 inch away from the flames to cook the naan from top. Note: yes naan will stick to tawa and will not fall of, this the reason you cannot use the nonstick skillet.

## Sourdough

- 1 cup 100% hydration sourdough starter discard (unfed)
- 1/2 cup warm milk
- 1/4 cup plain Greek yogurt
- 2 cups all purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- pinch of kosher salt
- 5 TBSP melted butter

1. In a large bowl mix together the sourdough starter, milk and yogurt until smooth.
1. Add the flour, baking powder and salt and stir to combine to a shaggy, somewhat tacky dough.
1. Cover with a damp cloth and let the dough rise in a warm place for 2-3 hours. You will know that it is done proofing when you can gently dent the dough with your knuckle and it springs back. If your house is warmer, this could take less time. If your house is colder, it may take more time.
1. Dump out on a lightly floured counter and knead for a minute or two, until smooth. You shouldn't need to add much extra flour, if any to make it not stick to your hands. It will still be tacky but not overly sticky.
1. Preheat a heavy cast iron skillet over medium-high heat.
1. Divide the dough into 8 pieces and roll each piece into about 0.8cm thickness. Use a small amount of flour on your counter and on your rolling pin to help you roll the dough out. The dough will be tacky to slightly sticky, but you should be able to easily work with it with the additon of a little flour.
1. Brush one side with melted butter and place butter-side down on the skillet.
1. Cook for about a minute, or until the dough starts to bubble and release from the skillet.
1. Brush the other side with melted butter and flip.
1. Cook for an additional minute.
1. Transfer to a plate and cover with a cloth to keep warm.
1. Repeat with remaining pieces of dough and Enjoy!
